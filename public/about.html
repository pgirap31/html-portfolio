<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Priyanka Girap. I am persuing my BE course from Xavier's Institute of Engineering, Mahim.
As of 2nd July, 2024 I am in second year of the course. I am trying to find my niche in tech by trying out various
courses. As a kid I dreamed of becoming an astronaut or at least work in a space agency. I am excited about what the 
future holds for me and I am very optimistic about it. People often consider me extremely friendly and sweet. I really love socializing and meeting new people.
Other than that I like baking. Honestly, food is my passion. I love cooking as well as eating food. My mom says I am a good cook so that explains a lot.
I hope we can be friends too.</p>
